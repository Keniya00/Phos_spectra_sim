You have to install gfortran and LAPACK/BLAS library for successfully running the code.

Before running the code you should have all the required data and files: WS0_DPPZ_THF.DAT(Normal mode Frequencies of S0 state)
WT1_DPPZ_THF.DAT(Normal mode Frequencies of Triplet state of interest),duschinsky_t1_s0.dat(Duschisnky rotation matrix between T1-S0 states),
displacement_t1_s0.dat(Displacement vector between T1-S0 state)
 in the same folder as the code.

You need to put the value of No. of normal modes(N), N1=2*N, Energy gap(DEL_E) in eV, Transition moment(DIPOLE) in a.u.,Temperature(TEMP) in Kelvin, 
Damping parameter(ETA) in cm-1, No.of iteration(NN),Initial Time(TI) in sec,Final Time(TF) in sec, in the code.

According to your system you should have chnage the value of all the required data.


################To compile the code use the command:################
gfortran phos_spectra_simulation.f90 -llapack -lblas
